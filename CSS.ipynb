    "# CSS\n",
    "**CSS** or **Cascading Style Sheets** is a language used for styling and formatting HTML documents. It helps to separate the presentation layer from the content layer, allowing us to apply consistent styles across multiple pages or an entire website.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS Reference: [Mozilla Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cascading\n",
    "**Cascading** refers to the **order** in which stylesheets are applied. In general, there are three types of stylesheets that can be applied to an HTML document:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **User Agent Stylesheets**: These are the default styles applied by the browser, such as font size and spacing. They have the lowest level of precedence, meaning any styles applied by the other two types of stylesheets will override them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **User Stylesheets**: These are styles that are applied based on user preferences, such as a user's chosen font size or color scheme. These stylesheets have a higher level of precedence than user agent stylesheets, but lower than author stylesheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Author Stylesheets**: These are the styles that we write ourselves, using CSS. They have the highest level of precedence, but this can be overridden by using the `!important` declaration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaration\n",
    "A **declaration** is a CSS **property-value pair** in the form `property: value;`. Properties are the attributes that we want to apply styles to, such as `font-size` or `color`. Values are the specific values that we want to apply to the properties, such as `16px` or `#000000`. For example: `font-size: 16px;`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaration Block\n",
    "A declaration block is a **group of declarations** surrounded by curly braces `{}`. This is how we group together multiple declarations that we want to apply to a particular element.\n",
    "```css\n",
    "{\n",
    "color: blue;\n",
    "margin: 10px;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This would apply a blue color and a 10 pixel margin to the element that it is applied to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ruleset\n",
    "A **ruleset** is a **selector** followed by a **declaration block**. The selector determines which elements on the page the ruleset will apply to, while the declaration block lists the styles that will be applied to those elements.\n",
    "```css\n",
    "selector {\n",
    "property: value;\n",
    "property: value;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "h1 {\n",
    "  color: red;\n",
    "  font-size: 24px;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This would apply a red color and a font size of 24 pixels to all h1 elements on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### `link`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<link>` tag is used in HTML to link external resources, such as stylesheets. The `<link>` tag is a self-closing tag and has two attributes that are required when linking to a stylesheet:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **rel**: This attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document. When linking to a stylesheet, this should be set to **stylesheet**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **href**: This attribute specifies the location of the linked document. It can be either an absolute or relative URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```css\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "```\n",
    "This would link to a stylesheet named `styles.css` located in the same directory as the HTML document."

    "### Selector\n",
    "It is a pattern used at the beginning of a **ruleset** for choosing which elements will be affected by the declarations. There are a variety of different selector types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Type selector**: Selects all of the elements of a specific HTML tag. For example, `h1` would select all `<h1>` elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class selector**: Selects all elements with a specific HTML **class** attribute. Class selectors are prefixed with a `.`, so for example `.foo` would select all HTML elements with the attribute `class=\"foo\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ID selector**: Selects an element with a specific HTML **ID** attribute. ID selectors are prefixed with a `#`, so for example `#bar` would select the HTML element with the attribute `id=\"bar\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Attribute selector**. Selects all elements with a specific HTML attribute set to a **specific value**. These are surrounded by `[]` and use a `=` as a delimiter between the attribute name and value. For example, `[type=\"submit\"]` would select all elements with a type attribute set to \"submit\". Also, excluding the value will select all elements with the attribute set to any value. For example, `[type]` would select all elements with the type attribute set, regardless of the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute selectors can also use special syntax for basic pattern matching within the value. There are a variety of options here, but these are some of the more common ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `[attribute*=value]` selector matches any element with an attribute that contains the specified value. For example, `[href*=\"google\"]` would match any element with an href attribute that contains the string `\"google\"` at any location.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `[attribute^=value]` selector matches any element with an attribute that starts with the specified value. For example, `[href^=\"https://\"]` would match any element with an href attribute that starts with `\"https://\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `[attribute$=value]` selector matches any element with an attribute that ends with the specified value. For example, `[href$=\".pdf\"]` would match any element with an href attribute that ends with `\".pdf\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `[attribute~=value]` selector matches any element with an attribute that contains the specified word. For example, `[class~=\"button\"]` would match any element with a class attribute that contains the word `\"button\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `[attribute|=value]` selector matches any element with an attribute that has a hyphen-separated value that starts with the specified value. For example, `[lang|=\"en\"]` would match any element with a lang attribute that has a value of `\"en\"` or `\"en-us\"` or `\"en-gb\"`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute selectors can be very powerful when used correctly, and they can help us select specific elements with complex attribute values. However, it's important to use them sparingly and to avoid selecting elements based on non-semantic attributes (such as `id` or `data-*` attributes used for scripting) as it can make our code harder to maintain and less semantically meaningful."

    "### Combinator\n",
    "Combinator combines multiple selectors to select elements based on their location in the DOM. There are a few types of combinators:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Descendant combinator**: Represented by a single space, in the format `selector1 selector2`. Selects all elements that match `selector2` and are a descendant of an element matching `selector1`. A descendant does not need to be a direct child (e.g. the selected element's grandparent could match `selector1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Child combinator**: Represented by `>`, in the format `selector1 > selector2`. Selects all elements that match `selector2` and are a direct child of an element matching `selector1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sibling combinator**: Represented by `~`, in the format `selector1 ~ selector2`. Selects all elements that match `selector2` and are a sibling of an element matching `selector 1`. The element matching `selector2` must come after the element matching `selector1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Adjacent sibling combinator**: Represented by `+`, in the format `selector1 + selector2`. Selects all elements that match `selector2` and have an element matching `selector1` directly before them in the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate combinators, let's consider the following HTML structure:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div class=\"container\">\n",
    "  <h1>Title</h1>\n",
    "  <p>Paragraph 1</p>\n",
    "  <p>Paragraph 2</p>\n",
    "  <ul>\n",
    "    <li>List item 1</li>\n",
    "    <li>List item 2</li>\n",
    "  </ul>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **descendant combinator** allows us to select all `p` elements that are descendants of the `di`v element with class `container`. We can write the following selector:\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".container p {\n",
    "  color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will set the color of all `p` elements inside the `div` with class `container` to red.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **child combinator** allows us to select all `li` elements that are direct children of the `ul` element inside the div with class `container`. We can write the following selector:\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".container > ul > li {\n",
    "  font-weight: bold;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will set the font weight of all `li` elements that are direct children of the `ul` element inside the div with class `container` to bold.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sibling combinator** allows us to select all `p` elements that are siblings of the `h1` element inside the div with class `container`. We can write the following selector:\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".container h1 ~ p {\n",
    "  font-style: italic;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will set the font style of all `p` elements that are siblings of the `h1` element inside the div with class `container` to italic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **adjacent sibling combinator** allows us to select the `p` element that immediately follows the `h1` element inside the div with class `container`. We can write the following selector:\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".container h1 + p {\n",
    "  text-transform: uppercase;\n",

    "### Pseudo Class\n",
    "It is an addition to a CSS selector for selecting based on the **current state** of the element. These start with `:`, so for example `button:hover` would select buttons currently hovered over.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pseudo Element\n",
    "It is an addition to a CSS selector for selecting a **specific portion** of the element. These start with `::`, so for example `p::first-letter` would select the first letter of paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "`::before` and `::after` are special pseudo elements that **insert children before or after the content** of the element, allowing for styling before or after the content. This is oftentimes used with CSS `content` property, but not always.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specificity\n",
    "It is the algorithm used by the browser to determine which CSS declarations to use when an element is selected by two rulesets with the same property.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specificity** is roughly calculated by counting the number of each selector type involved in a selector and multiplying by a weight. These weights are as follows:\n",
    "* **Inline Styles**: 1000\n",
    "* **IDs**: 100\n",
    "* **Classes**: 10\n",

    "\n",
    "### Relative Unit\n",
    " A unit whose value is **dependent** on something else. These are the most frequently used relative units:\n",
    "* **em**: Relative to the font size. For example, if the font size is `14px`, then `1.5em` would be `21px`. If the `em` unit is used to set font size, it will be relative to the parent's font size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **rem**: Relative to the root element's font size. By default, this is usually `16px`, but it can be overridden by the user stylesheet. Moreover, the author stylesheets can change this by setting a font size on the html selector or the `:root` pseudo class. For example, by default `1.5rem` will be `24px`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **%**: A percentage, usually of the parents value for the same property. For example, a width of `50%` would be half the size of the parent element's width.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **vw**: A percentage of the width of the viewport, for example `50vw` would be half of the width of the viewport.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **vh**: A percentage of the height of the viewport, for example `50vh` would be half of the height of the viewport.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ch**: The number of characters on a line, based on the width of the \"0\" character in the element's font, not the number of characters on a line. This means that the width of `1ch` will vary depending on the font being used. This can be useful to prevent paragraphs from spanning more than ~70 characters in width, which can become hard to read. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Block Element\n",
    "An element with its `display` property set to `block` . These have a few key properties:\n",
    "* They start on new lines.\n",
    "* By default they span the entire width of their parent. This means that they create a \"block\" of content that forces other elements to be placed below them. \n",
    "* Block elements are commonly used for structural elements like headings, paragraphs, and lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inline Element\n",
    "An element with its `display` property set to `inline` . These have a few key properties:\n",
    "* They do not start on a new line instead start immediately after the content before them.\n",
    "* They span the width of their content. This means that they \"flow\" alongside other inline elements and can be nested within block-level elements.\n",

    "The **box model** refers to the way that the browser lays out elements on a web page. Each element is treated as a **rectangular box** that has four components: **content, padding, border** and **margin**. The box model is important to understand because it affects the size and position of elements on a web page, and can be used to create complex layouts.\n",

    "#### border\n",
    "A property used to create a border around the content and padding of an element. The `border` CSS property is a\n",
    "shorthand for `border-color`, `border-style` and `border-width` , which it takes as space separated values in any\n",
    "order. For example, `border: 1px solid black` would create a one pixel, solid black border.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `border-radius` can also be used to create rounded corners on an element, regardless of if it has a border. This\n",
    "defines the radius of the corners, and a value of `50%` is often used on square elements to create a circle.\n",

    "A value of `auto` can also be used to allow the browser to choose margins, which will usually center block elements\n",
    "horizontally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjacent horizontal margins will be added together to determine the space between elements. Vertical margins on the\n",

    "\n",
    "A layout model, also known as the **Flexible Box Layout Module**, particularly useful for building responsive designs with row or column layouts. An element can be made a **flex container** with `display: flex` , and all of its direct children will automatically be laid out as **flex items**. It also simplifies layout for complex designs that need to adjust to different content sizes or user actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For flex containers, these are some of the most common properties used to layout their flex items:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **flex-direction**: Determines which direction is the **main-axis**, either `row` or `column` . Additionally, `row-reverse` and `column-reverse` can be used to reverse the order of flex items.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **justify-content**: Determines how elements are positioned along the **main-axis** with possible values of `flex-start` , `flex-end`, `center` , `space-around` , `space-between` , and `space-evenly` .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **align-items**: Determines how elements are positioned along the **cross-axis** (the one not selected by `flex-direction` ). Possible values are `flex-start` , `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline` ,and `stretch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **flex-wrap**: Determines if flex items can wrap to new lines with possible values of `wrap` and `nowrap` . `wrap-reverse` can also be used to wrap flex items with the lines in reverse order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **align-content**: Determines how multiple rows or columns of flex items are positioned along the **cross-axis** when flex items are wrapping on multiple lines. Possible values are `flex-start` , `flex-end`, `center` , `space-around` , `space-between`, and `stretch`. This property only applies when flex items are wrapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **flex-flow**: A shorthand for setting both `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` properties in one declaration. For example, `flex-flow: row wrap;` would set the `flex-direction` to `row` and `flex-wrap` to `wrap`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **gap**: Determines the amount of space between flex items. This can take one or two length values. If it is given two, they will be treated as a **row gap** and a **column gap** respectively. Alternatively, a `row-gap` and `column-gap` property can be specified to individually set the gap between rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **justify-items**: Aligns flex items within a flex container when there is extra space in both the **main** and **cross-axis**. This property only applies when the flex container has a grid layout, which is a newer addition to the Flexbox specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "For flex items, these are some of the most common properties used to position themselves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **align-self**: Overrides the `align-items` value used for the flex container.\n",
    "\n",

    "* **flex-basis**: Sets the initial size of the flex item along the **main-axis** (essentially this will act as width for the row axis and height for the column axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **flex-grow**: Determines if the flex item is able to grow into extra space. If the value is 0, the flex item will not grow. Otherwise, it will take up as much extra space as possible, with larger grow values taking more space proportionally. For example, if item A has a value of 1 and item B has a value of 2, then item B will take up twice as much extra space as item A (Note this does not mean it will be twice as large, only that it will take twice as much of the extra space).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **flex-shrink**: Determines if a flex item is able to shrink in the case that the flex items are too large for the container. Flex items with a value of 0 will not shrink. Otherwise they will all shrink proportionally based on their values, similar to flex grow. The higher the value, the more the flex item will potentially shrink.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **flex**: A shorthand property for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` , and `flex-basis` in that order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **order**: Moves the flex-item to a different location amongst the other flex items rather than using the order defined in the DOM. All flex items default to having a value of 0. This means a value of -1 would move an item before all other items that have not changed their order. Likewise, a value of 1 would place the item at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of Flexbox:\n",
    "```html\n",

    "* **Modifiers**: Flags to change styles for blocks or elements, such as `disabled` or `selected`. These are prefixed by the class they modify and two dashes, and they are included in addition to that original class such as `class=\"menu menu--disabled\"` .\n",

    "### OOCSS\n",
    "The **Object-Oriented** CSS methodology. This is based on object-oriented programming principles, which can be applied to\n",
    "CSS class design by treating UI components as objects. Styles are then given one of two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Structure**: \"Invisible\" properties such as width and margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Skin**: \"Visible\" properties such as color and border.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with separating structure and skin into classes, OOCSS also makes a clear distinction between **content** and\n",
    "**containers**. The idea here is that containers should function the same, regardless of the content inside of them. Moreover, content should not depend on the container it is nested within.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Atomic CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSS methodology based on the idea of minimizing any repeated declarations. Rather than creating classes based on\n",
    "components, Atomic CSS creates utility classes based on single declarations. For example, in Atomic CSS a `margin-12`\n",
    "class might be created that adds 12 pixels of margin, rather than including that declaration on all of the components\n",
    "needing 12 pixels of margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SMACSS\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Scalable and Modular Architecture For CSS** methodology, usually pronounced as \"smacks\". This splits CSS into five\n",
    "different categories, each of which get their own file:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Base**: Page defaults, usually just type selectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Layout**: Major structural layout of the page, using ID and class selectors. The classes are usually prefixed with `l-` or `layout-` . For example, a navigation element might have the class `l-nav` .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Module**: Smaller reusable components, usually using class selectors without any name prefixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **State**: Specific states for layouts or modules, such as disabled or selected states, usually using class selectors again.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Theme**: Style rules for layouts and modules related to a theme, oftentimes based on user preferences such as a dark\n",
    "mode.\n",

    "### ITCSS\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Inverted Triangle** CSS methodology. This methodology is mostly focused on the order of CSS code, rather than\n",
    "having opinions on naming conventions. The primary idea here is to have generic styles first, which should have the largest reach across elements and the least specific selectors. The exact layers of the triangle can be changed to fit the needs of a specific project, but a general structure looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Settings**: Global variables affecting the entire website.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tools**: Mixins and functions for use with **preprocessors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Generic**: High level generic styles, usually to reset browser defaults for consistency across browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Elements**: Defaults for elements using type selectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Objects**: The most generic classes, oftentimes for larger containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Components**: Classes for individual UI components.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Trumps**: `!important` overrides for when they are needed."

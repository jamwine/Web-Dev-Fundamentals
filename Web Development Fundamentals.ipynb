    "**HyperText Markup Language** is the primary language of the web, containing the content and structure of a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tag\n",
    "The primary method of marking up content using HTML. **Tags** use the syntax `<tagname>content</tagname>`\n",
    "For example, **paragraphs** use the `p` tag, for instance: `<p>Hello World</p>`. HTML tags are **not case sensitive**: `<P>` means the same as `<p>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The left side tag, such as `<p>`, is referred to as the **opening tag**. The right side tag, such as `</p>` is referred to as the **closing tag**. Everything inside of the tags is the **content**, which will actually be rendered on the page. The combination of the opening tag, content and closing tag are referred to as a **complete element**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tags don't have any content, so we call these **empty tags** or **self-closing tags**. These either use the opening tag syntax or `<tagname />`.\n",
    "For example, **horizontal rules** use the `hr` tag, so we could create a horizontal rule with either `<hr>` or `<hr />`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attribute\n",
    "Extra information provided to HTML elements, similar to function parameters. **Attributes** are always specified in the start tag and uses the syntax `<tagname attribute=\"value\">content</tagname>`. The attribute name will always come after the tag name, with a space in between them. The quoted value will then be separated from the attribute name by an equals sign, i.e. **name/value pairs** like: `name=\"value\"`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can create an input of type \"checkbox\" with `<input type=\"checkbox\" />`\n",
    "\n",
    "### \\<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "The required first line of every HTML file for telling the browser what version of html to use. A **doctype** of html will use the modern HTML5 standard. While a page will usually render properly without a doctype declaration, they should still always be included as some older browsers will not render pages following the modern specification without it (this is sometimes called \"quirks\" mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "The text between `<html>` and `</html>` describes an HTML document. The HTML document itself begins with `<html>` and ends with </html>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \\<head>\n",
    "The tag containing **metadata** about the HTML document (i.e. anything that isn't displayed on the page). The `<head>` of the HTML file should be the first tag within the `<html>` tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<title>` is the only required tag within the `<head>`. This tag gives the page a title, which is used for the name of the tab in most browsers, and it gets used for search results in many search engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, links, scripts, and other meta information. The following tags describe metadata: `<title>`, `<style>`, `<meta>`, `<link>`, `<script>`, and `<base>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### \\<body>\n",
    "The tag containing the visible page **content** of the webpage. The `<body>` of the HTML file should be the second tag within the `<html>` tag, just below the `<head>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic HTML Example\n",
    "```html \n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html lang=\"en\">\n",
    "  <head>\n",
    "    <title>My Page Title</title>\n",
    "  </head>\n",
    "  <body>\n",
    "    <h1>My First Heading</h1>\n",
    "    <p>Hello World!</p>\n",
    "  </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### \\<meta>\n",
    "The `<meta>` element is used to specify which character set is used, page description, keywords, author, and other **metadata**. \n",
    "* Define the character set used: \n",
    "`<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define a description of your web page:\n",
    "`<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web tutorial\">`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define keywords for search engines:\n",
    "`<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"HTML, CSS, XML, JavaScript\">`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define the author of a page:\n",
    "`<meta name=\"author\" content=\"John Doe\">`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Refresh document every 30 seconds:\n",
    "`<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"30\">`\n",
    "\n",
    "### \\<title>\n",
    "The text between `<title>` and `</title>` provides a **title** for the document and is required in all HTML/XHTML documents. The `<title>` element:\n",
    "*\tdefines a title in the browser tab\n",
    "*\tprovides a title for the page when it is added to favorites\n",
    "*\tdisplays a title for the page in search engine results\n",
    "\n",
    "### \\<p>\n",
    "The **paragraph** tag is used for blocks of text (although they can contain other elements that are part of the paragraph, such as images). For example: `<p>Hello World!</p>`\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML paragraphs can have a **title attribute**. For example: `<p title=\"Hey\">Hello World!</p>`. The value of the attribute is `Hey` and can be displayed as a tooltip information when we move the mouse over the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heading Tags\n",
    "HTML tags represented by `<h1>` through `<h6>` are **heading** tags. `<h1>` is the top level heading and defines the most important heading, `<h2>` is a secondary subheading, and so on. `<h6>` defines the least important heading. Browsers automatically add some empty space (a margin) before and after each heading. \n",
    "\n",
    "Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of our web pages. It is important to use headings to show the document structure. For example: `<h1>Main Heading</h1>` and `<h2>Secondary Heading</h2>`\n",
    "\n",
    "### \\<img>\n",
    "HTML images are defined with the `<img>` tag. This is an empty tag (does not have a closing tag), and it should always include two primary attributes:\n",
    "* **src**: The path to the image, either *relative* or *absolute*.\n",
    "* **alt**: Alternative text to be used with screen readers or any time the image cannot be displayed.\n",
    "* Optional size attributes **width** and **height**, the image size is specified in pixels: `width=\"104\"` means `104` screen pixels wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: `<img src=\"imgs/dog.png\" alt=\"dog\" width=\"104\" height=\"142\" />`\n",
    "\n",
    "### \\<li>\n",
    "The **list** item tag, used for individual elements in both **unordered** and **ordered** lists. List items can also contain other HTML elements like images, links, etc or other lists to create **nested lists** (lists inside lists). \n",
    "    \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>Coffee</li>\n",
    "  <li>Tea\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "      <li>Black tea</li>\n",
    "      <li>Green tea</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "  </li>\n",
    "  <li>Milk</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "### \\<ul>\n",
    "An **unordered list** starts with the `<ul>` tag, used for a list where the order does not matter. By default, most browsers will show this as a **bulleted list**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unordered list should contain any number of `<li>` tags. For example:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>Coffee</li>\n",
    "  <li>Tea</li>\n",
    "  <li>Milk</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "### \\<ol>\n",
    "An ordered list starts with the `<ol>` tag, used for a list where the order matters. The list items will be marked with **numbers** by default.\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li>Coffee</li>\n",
    "  <li>Tea</li>\n",
    "  <li>Milk</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **type** attribute of the `<ol>` tag, defines the type of the list item marker.\n",
    "* \t`type=\"1\"` : The list items will be numbered with numbers (default)\n",
    "* \t`type=\"A\"` : The list items will be numbered with uppercase letters\n",
    "* \t`type=\"a\"` : The list items will be numbered with lowercase letters\n",
    "* \t`type=\"I\"` : The list items will be numbered with uppercase roman numbers\n",
    "* \t`type=\"i\"` : The list items will be numbered with lowercase roman numbers\n",

    "For example:\n",
    "```html\n",

    "  <li>Coffee</li>\n",
    "  <li>Tea</li>\n",
    "  <li>Milk</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description list\n",
    "HTML also supports description lists. A **description list** is a list of terms, with a description of each **term**. The `<dl>` tag defines the description list, the `<dt>` tag defines the term (name), and the `<dd>` tag describes each term. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "```html\n",
    "<dl>\n",
    "  <dt>Coffee</dt>\n",
    "  <dd>- Best drink</dd>\n",
    "  <dt>Tea</dt>\n",
    "  <dd>- Good drink</dd>\n",
    "</dl>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### \\<br>\n",
    "HTML elements with no content are called **empty elements**. `<br>` is an empty element without a closing tag. `<br>` tag defines a **line break** i.e. (a new line) without starting a new paragraph. Empty elements can be *closed* in the opening tag like this: `<br />`. HTML5 does not require empty elements to be closed. But if we want stricter validation, or we need to make our document readable by XML parsers, we should close all HTML elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: This tag should not be used just for spacing out elements as that can be accomplished with CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \\<hr>\n",
    "The `<hr>` tag is an empty tag that defines a **thematic break** in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a **horizontal line**. The `<hr>` element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \\<pre>\n",
    "The HTML `<pre>` element defines **preformatted text**. This tag preserves **whitespace**, both spaces and line breaks. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "  Change is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Change is normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Do not deny it, embrace it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Let it amplify you.\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### \\<a> \n",
    "The **anchor tag** `<a>` is used for linking to other pages. This tag should include an **href** attribute with the path to the page being linked (absolute or relative). HTML links are hyperlinks. A link does not have to be text, it can be an image or any other HTML element. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **target** attribute specifies where to open the linked document. The target attribute can have one of the following values:\n",
    "* \t`_blank` - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab\n",
    "* \t`_self` - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default)\n",
    "* \t`_parent` - Opens the linked document in the parent frame\n",
    "* \t`_top` - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window\n",
    "* \t`framename` - Opens the linked document in a named frame\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: `<a href=\"https://datajoins.com\" target=\"_blank\">Datajoins</a>`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Formatting Tags\n",
    "HTML also defines special elements for defining text with a special meaning. **Formatting elements** were designed to display special types of text:\n",
    "* \t`<b>` - Bold text\n",
    "* \t`<strong>` - Important text (usually rendered as bold by default)\n",
    "* \t`<i>` - Italic text\n",
    "* \t`<em>` - Emphasized text (usually rendered as italics by default)\n",
    "* \t`<mark>` - Marked text\n",
    "* \t`<small>` - Small text\n",
    "* \t`<del>` - Deleted text\n",
    "* \t`<ins>` - Inserted text\n",
    "* \t`<sub>` - Subscript text\n",
    "* \t`<sup>` - Superscript text\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTML `<b>` element defines bold text, without any extra importance. The HTML `<strong>` element defines strong text, with added semantic \"strong\" importance. Similarly, The HTML `<i>` element defines italic text, without any extra importance and the HTML `<em>` element defines emphasized text, with added semantic importance."

For example, `rgb (255, 0, 0)` is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (`255`) and the others are set to `0`. To display the color black, all color parameters must be set to `0`, like this: `rgb (0, 0, 0)`. To display the color white, all color parameters must be set to `255`, like this: `rgb (255,255,255)`. Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all the 3 light sources.\n",

    "### Block-level and inline elements\n",

A block-level element always **starts on a new line** and takes up the **full width available** (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). The `<div>` element is a block-level element. Examples of block-level elements:\n",

    "### \\<div>\n",
